To solve the problem of unaffordable payments, policymakers should require loans to be repayable in small installments that are affordable for most borrowers. Research shows that in order to fit the budgets of typical payday loan borrowers, payments must not exceed 5 percent of monthly income.

Another solution that has been proposed is to require lenders to conduct underwriting to assess the borrowers’ ability to repay. However, without clear product safety standards, such as limiting loan payments to 5 percent of a borrower’s paycheck, this approach carries risk. It can add substantially to the price of loans by imposing new costs on lenders. And because lenders have access to borrowers’ checking accounts or car titles and can collect even if borrowers lack the ability to repay, it provides lenders with little incentive to ensure that payments are truly affordable.
