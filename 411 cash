Some high-interest installment loans have unreasonably long terms, with only a small portion of each payment reducing the loan’s balance. Excessive loan lengths can double or triple borrowers’ costs,26 and very long loan durations also pose risk to borrowers with volatile incomes. In lower-income months, they may struggle to afford loan payments but have little choice because lenders have access to their checking accounts or car titles. Pew’s research has found that even at high interest rates, six months is generally long enough to repay a $500 loan, and one year is typically sufficient for a $1,000 loan.27 Similarly, the public considers very short terms (less than a month) or very long terms (more than a year) to be unreasonable for a $500 loan.
